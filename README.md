This repository is part of the REMLA25 project by team 13 and contains the machine learning training pipeline for sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews.

## Features
- Loads the historic restaurant reviews dataset.
- Preprocesses data using `lib-ml`.
- Trains and evaluates the sentiment model.
- Versions and releases the model for deployment.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the training:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remla25-team13/model-training.git
cd model-training
docker build -t model-training .
docker run --rm model-training
```

Or run the pipeline through DVC:
```bash
dvc repro
```

### Loading the dataset
We load the dataset automatically through `dvc repro`. For this to work properly, you need to define the `GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_DATA` environment variable. `GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_DATA` holds the necessary information to load the Google Cloud Service Account responsible for managing our data.

![Bandit](https://img.shields.io/badge/security-bandit-yellow)

- **Pylint** with a custom plugin detecting ML-specific code smells 
- **Flake8** with a non-default configuration: increased line length, common ignore rules
- **Bandit** with a tailored `bandit.yaml` to focus on relevant Python security risks

This project enforces code quality through three linters, all run automatically in the **GitHub Actions workflow** defined in [`quality.yml`](.github/workflows/quality.yml):

### âœ… How They Are Run

- **Pylint**
  - Run with:
    ```bash
    PYTHONPATH=. pylint review_rating --rcfile=.pylintrc
    ```
  - Includes a custom plugin (`pylint_plugins/ml_checks.py`) that detects machine learning-specific code smells.
  - The Pylint score is parsed in CI and used to update the README badge.

- **Flake8**
  - Run with:
    ```bash
    flake8 review_rating
    ```
  - Configured via `requirements-dev.txt` with extended line length and common ignore rules.

- **Bandit**
  - Run with:
    ```bash
    bandit -r review_rating -c bandit.yaml
    ```
  - Uses a tailored config to detect security issues relevant to ML workflows.

## ðŸ¤– Custom Pylint Rules for ML Code Smells

This project includes a custom Pylint plugin (`pylint_plugins/ml_checks.py`) that also implements a ML-specific code smell detector inspired by [ml-smells](https://hynn01.github.io/ml-smells/). These rules help prevent common mistakes in data science and machine learning workflows:

| Rule ID  | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `W9001`  | `predict()` called on training data (`X_train`) â€” may indicate data leakage|
| `W9002`  | `.values` used on DataFrames â€” prefer `df.to_numpy()`                      |

These checks are integrated into our CI using `pylint` with a custom `.pylintrc` and are automatically run and scored.

## ðŸ§ª ML Test Score

The ML Test Score is automatically computed in the GitHub workflow and follows the [ML Test Score methodology](https://research.google/pubs/the-ml-test-score-a-rubric-for-ml-production-readiness-and-technical-debt-reduction/).
