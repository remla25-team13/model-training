This repository is part of the REMLA25 project by team 13 and contains the machine learning training pipeline for sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews.

## Features
- Loads the historic restaurant reviews dataset.
- Preprocesses data using `lib-ml`.
- Trains and evaluates the sentiment model.
- Versions and releases the model for deployment.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the training:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remla25-team13/model-training.git
cd model-training
docker build -t model-training .
docker run --rm model-training
```

Or run the pipeline through DVC:
```bash
dvc repro
```

## üîí Linters Used

| Tool     | Purpose                            | Configuration        |
|----------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `pylint` | Logic issues, structure, ML rules  | `.pylintrc`, plugin   |
| `flake8` | PEP-8 compliance                   | `.flake8`             |
| `bandit` | Security vulnerability scanning    | `bandit.yaml`         |

## üîç Custom Pylint Rules

This project includes custom Pylint rules defined in `pylint_plugins/ml_checks.py` to catch common ML code issues:

- `fit-missing-y`: Warns when `.fit(X)` is called with only one argument ‚Äî possible missing labels.
- `predict-on-training-data`: Warns when `.predict(X_train)` is used ‚Äî this may indicate you're evaluating on training data instead of a test split.

These rules are automatically enforced in CI.
